* [**Implemented Dynamic Feature in Authorizer Android Application **](https://github.com/Jirigesi/authorizer)<br>
Google Play’s app serving model, called Dynamic Delivery, uses Android App Bundles to generate and serve optimized APKs for each user’s device configuration, so users download only the code and resources they need to run your app. You no longer have to build, sign, and manage multiple APKs to support different devices, and users get smaller, more optimized downloads.
I refactored the App Authorizer, so that it could achieve Dynamic Delivery in Google Play.
