<br />

My name is Jiri Gesi (Гиллигс in Mongolian, **吉日格斯** in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Donald Bren School**</a>,  <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**University of California, Irvine**</a> - one of the top schools on Software Engineering researches according to <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">*csRanking.org*</a>. Before join UCI, I was a Machine Learning Engineer in Ford, USA. 

<br />

I specialize in mining data and leverage machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems for outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks and etc. 

My research focuses on the interaction of two fields:

- Machine learning systems that can automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming language and natural language.
- Software engineering tasks that can help developers develop software faster with less bugs.

At UCI, I work with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Iftekhar Ahmed**</a> in <a href="http://stairs.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">**STAIRS Lab**</a> on software defect prediction using deep learning techniques.
