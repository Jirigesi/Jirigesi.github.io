### About me 

I'm currently an **Applied Scientist** at **Amazon Search** (formerly A9), where I specialize in developing Large Foundation Models. My work involves using advanced AI techniques to pre-train and fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand customer behaviors and product characteristics. This helps us unlock the full potential of LLMs for creating better retrieval and ranking models for both organic search results and advertisements. I hold a PhD in Representation Learning of Programming Languages from UC, Irvine.

<br />

I love traveling, hitting up music festivals, and saying 'Yes!'. I enjoy coding and reading research papers.

### My research

The embedding or dense vector representation of text captures its semantic information, enabling its use in various downstream applications such as retrieval, reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks. This method is essential for embedding-based retrieval systems, which play a crucial role in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG allows large language models (LLMs) to access the latest external or proprietary knowledge without altering the model parameters.. And my research focuses on: 

<br />

_How can we train AI systems to efficiently and accurately represent the human behaviors and products for LLM?_

<br />

My team at Amazon Science is researching how to train large Natural Language Processing models to generate embeddings that represent customer online behaviors for organic and advertisement ranking. We're also developing embeddings for store products to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of our 'ChatGPT for shopping' agent, among other projects.
