Jiri Gesi (Гиллигс in Mongolian, 吉日格斯 in Chinese) is a Ph.D. Candidate at <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Donald Bren School**</a>,  <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**University of California, Irvine**</a> - one of the top schools at Software Engineering research according to <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">*csRanking.org*</a>. Before joining UC Irvine, he was a Machine Learning Engineer at Ford, USA. 

<br />

He specializes in mining data and leveraging machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems. He has experience in outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks and etc. 

His research focuses on the interaction of two fields:

- Machine learning systems can be used to automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming and natural language.
- Software engineering tasks that can help programmers use fewer resources to develop higher-quality software

At UC Irvine, he works with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Iftekhar Ahmed**</a> at <a href="http://stairs.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">**STAIRS Lab**</a> on leveraging natural language proccessing techniques to improve the understanding of programming languages by AI models.
