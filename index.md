2022 Summer Internship: Open to ML/AI researh or software development internship. Please reach out! 

<br />

My name is Jiri Gesi (吉日格斯 in Chinese). I am a third year Ph.D. student at Donal Bren School, University of California, Irvine - one of the best school for software engineering research based on CS Ranking. Before join UCI, I was a Machine Learning Engineer in Ford, USA. 

<br />

I specialize in mining data and leverage machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems for outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks. 

My research focuses on the interaction of two fields:

- machine learning systems that can automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming language and natural language
- software engineering tasks that can help developers develop software faster with better quality 

Jiri is currently a Research Assistant at the Software Engineering & Testing Using Artificial Intelligence for Reliable Software (STAIRS) lab within the ICS department at UC Irvine. He works with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Iftekhar Ahmed</a> in Department of Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences in <a href="https://uci.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Irvine</a> 



His main research interests are Software Engineering for Machine Learning (SE4ML), Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE), Natural Language Analysis, Mutation Analysis, and Program Analysis.
