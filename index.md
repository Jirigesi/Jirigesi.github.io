2022 Summer Internship: Open to ML/AI research or software development internship. Please reach out! 

<br />

My name is Jiri Gesi (Гиллигс in Mongolian, 吉日格斯 in Chinese). I am a third year Ph.D. student at <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">*Donald Bren School*</a>,  <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">*University of California, Irvine*</a> - one of the top three school for software engineering research according to <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**csRanking.org**</a>. Before join UCI, I was a Machine Learning Engineer in Ford, USA. 

<br />

I specialize in mining data and leverage machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems for outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks. 

My research focuses on the interaction of two fields:

- Machine learning systems that can automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming language and natural language.
- Software engineering tasks that can help developers develop software faster with better quality outcome. 

At UCI, I work with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Iftekhar Ahmed**</a> from STAIRS Lab on software defect prediction.
