<br />

My name is Jiri Gesi (Гиллигс in Mongolian, 吉日格斯 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Donald Bren School**</a>,  <a style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**University of California, Irvine**</a> - one of the top schools in Software Engineering researches according to <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">*csRanking.org*</a>. Before joining UC Irvine, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Ford, USA. 

<br />

I specialize in mining data and leveraging machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems. I have experience in outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks and etc. 

My research focuses on the interaction of two fields:

- Machine learning systems can be used to automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming and natural language.
- Software engineering tasks that can help programmers use fewer resources to develop higher-quality software

At UC Irvine, I work with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">**Iftekhar Ahmed**</a> in <a href="http://stairs.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">**STAIRS Lab**</a> on software defect prediction using deep learning techniques.
