I"<p>2022 Summer Internship: Open to ML/AI research or software development internship. Please reach out!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>My name is Jiri Gesi (Гиллигс in Mongolian, 吉日格斯 in Chinese). I am a third year Ph.D. student at <a target="_blank" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)"><strong>Donal Bren School</strong></a>, University of California, Irvine - one of the best school for software engineering research based on CS Ranking. Before join UCI, I was a Machine Learning Engineer in Ford, USA.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I specialize in mining data and leverage machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems for outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the interaction of two fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>machine learning systems that can automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming language and natural language</li>
  <li>software engineering tasks that can help developers develop software faster with better quality</li>
</ul>

<p>At UCI, I work with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(255,128,0)"><strong>Iftekhar Ahmed</strong></a> from STAIRS Lab on software defect prediction.</p>
