<p>My name is Jiri Gesi (ÂêâÊó•Ê†ºÊñØ in Chinese). I am a third year Ph.D. student at Donal Bren School, University of California, Irvine - one of the best school for software engineering research based on CS Ranking. Before join UCI, I was a Machine Learning Engineer in Ford, USA.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I specialize in mining data and leverage machine learning techniques to design and build machine learning systems for outlier detection, classification, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the interaction of two fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>machine learning systems that can automatically identify underlying patterns in sequential data, such as programming language and natural language</li>
  <li>software engineering tasks that can help developers develop software faster with better quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Jiri is currently a Research Assistant at the Software Engineering &amp; Testing Using Artificial Intelligence for Reliable Software (STAIRS) lab within the ICS department at UC Irvine. He works with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_TdMD7sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Iftekhar Ahmed</a> in Department of Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences in <a href="https://uci.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Irvine</a></p>

<p>His main research interests are Software Engineering for Machine Learning (SE4ML), Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE), Natural Language Analysis, Mutation Analysis, and Program Analysis.</p>
